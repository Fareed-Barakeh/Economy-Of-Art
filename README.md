# Economy-Of-Art
This project was developed during my Data Science Practicum at TU Berlin in collaboration with my group. We explored how characteristics of artworks and artists influence auction prices. Using a dataset of 37,000+ paintings valued at $9.47B, we analyzed correlations between features such as color brightness and artist nationality with market value.
